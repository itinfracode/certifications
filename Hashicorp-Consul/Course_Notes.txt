What's consul ?
    - Cloud networking automation for dynamic infrastructure
        - Service discovery
        - Service segmentation
        - Service configuration

    - Platform / Application & Cloud Agnostic

Enterprise version has additional -
    - Automated backups
    - Automated upgrades

Core Features :-
    - Dynamic Service Registration
    - Service discovery
    - Distributed Health Checks
    - Centralized K/V Storage
    - ACL
    - Segmentation of services
    - Cross cloud/data center availability
    - API / UI & Cli interfaces

Service Discovery :-
    - Centralized service registry
        - Registry keeps track about which node is healthy and which node is unhealthy.
    - Reduce or eliminate load balancers for frontend services
    - Realtime Health Monitoring through local agents
        - Node level health checks
        - Application level health checks
    - Automate networking and security using identity-based auth
        -  Avoiding ip/firewall based security
    - Seamless traffic redirection among multiple Data centers

Service Mesh :-
    - Enable secure communication between different services
        - Uses mTLS
        - Sidecar architecture (Alongside the registered service)
        - (Envoy proxy) Transparently handles inbound/outbound connection
    - Define ACL for services
        - Define which service can establish connectivity to other service
    - Consul will push out a mtls certificate whenever you create a new intention for a service to ensure denial of the connectivity.

Network Automation :-
    - Allows dynamic load balancing between services which are supported by consul 
        - Send traffic to healthy node / service
        - In case of multiple instances available for same service, use traffic shaping to influence how traffic is sent
    - Support other networking solutions
        - F5 / Nginx / HAProxy / Envoy
    - L7 Traffic Management
        - Service Failover
        - Path based routing (sub-directory)
        - Traffic Shifting
    - Increase L7 visibility metrics can be enabled on Envoy Proxy
        - Connections
        - Timeouts
        - Open circuits
        - etc.

Service configuration :-
    - Distributed K/V Store
        - All data gets replicated to all the consul servers
        - Store configuration & parameters
        - Can be accessed by client or server agent through cli, ui or api
        - Very important to enable ACL to restrict access to objects.
        - KV object size can be maximum 512 KB / No restriction on type of the object
        - Not a directory structure
